#------ Parameter for Noise Cross-Corrleation -----------#

#-------Main Directory-------#
main_dir =  /PARA/pp466/PKUSummer/NoiseCC
# Contain data file and station list
# data store format is :
#   xxxxx/2000_1_1_0_0_0/yyyy.LHZ.SAC
#   xxxxx in file_dir and yyyy in station.lst.all

#------Code Directory -------#

code_dir = /PARA/pp466/PKUSummer/NOISE_CODE_xia_v1/CODE

# Contain code file:
#   SET_SACDB, CUT_TRANS, FTA, NEWCORR, STACK ....

#--------Cut Window ---------#
# Make sure each trace have same length
#Example:
# cut_start_time = 1000
# cut_length = 84000

cut_start_time = 1000

cut_length = 84000

# the cut_start_time means the start time related to day file (2000-1-1 00:00:00)
# cut_length means the total number cutting points 
# PS: the length of time windows is (cut_length * delta) s

# ----- Filter Period ---------#
# Example:
# filter_range = [51, 50, 5, 4]

filter_range = [51, 50, 5, 4]

# The process of filtering use bandpass filter
# filter_range[0] and filter_range[3] means the max and min period
# filter_range[1] and filter_range[2] shows corner period 
# the unit of parameter is second

# ----- Cross Correlation -----#
# Example:
# correlation_length = 5000

correlation_length = 5000

# The cross correlation window 
# It is the number of points
# PS: This parameter domanate the maxium time of the result
#     (correlation_length * delta)

# ------ Stack Traces --------#
# Example:
# thresold_days = 20

thresold_days = 20
# Control the threold days for each month file,
# To get stable singal, we should have enough record in one month.
# as a result, station pairs less than 'thresold_days' are ignored.
